Check how often the callback recives data

Is the formula correct for getting x,y, and th values

are the encoder counts per revolution body_width and such all acurate

Check the hz (rate) of other nodes publishing to this

The callback does not follow the while loop here but rater updates every time the topic gets a new message

Not sure if we need to change the th value to a odom_quat

Dividing by two int distance_left = ((left_tick - pre_l_tick) / encoder_counts_per_rev) * wheel_circum

Check all the + and - in formula
